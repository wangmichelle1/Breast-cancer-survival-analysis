We aim to predict breast cancer survival in years by using breast cancer patient data from the [Netherlands Cancer Institute(NKI)](https://data.world/deviramanan2016/nki-breast-cancer-data). Our predictor works by identifying various physiological features and their relation to patient survival. We made various models including k-nearest neighbors, random tree, random forest, PCA, multiple regression, and LASSO to better predict survival. Our goal is to make models that allow cancer patients to predict their survival in years given their personal input values such as age, grade, and protein expression. Multiple regression is our best model in predicting survival given the top 43 proteins we found to be the most important. Regardless, all our models should not be used to actually predict survival as they all represent bad or very weak relationship between the x-variables and y-variable.
